                <h2>Textiles as Cultural Expression</h2>
                <p>Textiles represent one of the most significant aspects of Swedish cottage design, serving simultaneously as functional necessity, creative expression, and cultural statement. In a society where women's work—particularly textile production—was central to household economy and community status, textiles embodied skill, knowledge, and aesthetic sensibility.</p>
                <p>Swedish textiles demonstrate remarkable sophistication: colors derived from natural dyes, patterns reflecting regional traditions and family lineages, and techniques refined through generations. Every textile told stories about its maker's knowledge, family heritage, and community identity.</p>

                <h2>Traditional Weaving Techniques</h2>

                <h3>Loom Types and Capabilities</h3>
                <p>Swedish cottage weaving employed several types of looms, each capable of creating different textiles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Upright Looms:</strong> Simple frame looms for basic cloth production</li>
                    <li><strong>Horizontal Looms:</strong> Floor looms allowing complex pattern work and larger pieces</li>
                    <li><strong>Tablet Looms:</strong> Portable card looms for decorative braids and narrow bands</li>
                    <li><strong>Rigid Heddle Looms:</strong> Efficient production of everyday textiles</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Key Weaving Structures</h3>
                <p>Different weaving techniques created textiles suited to various purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plain Weave:</strong> Simple over-under pattern creating sturdy, versatile cloth for everyday use</li>
                    <li><strong>Twill:</strong> Diagonal pattern creating strong, durable fabric for work clothes and heavy-duty textiles</li>
                    <li><strong>Pattern Weaving:</strong> Complex color arrangements creating decorative patterns using multiple yarn colors</li>
                    <li><strong>Damask Weave:</strong> Sophisticated linen weaving creating patterns through structural variation rather than color</li>
                    <li><strong>Rep Weave:</strong> Textured surface from varied yarn thickness, creating visual interest</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Natural Dyes and Color</h2>

                <h3>Traditional Dye Sources</h3>
                <p>Swedish textile colors emerged from readily available plant materials:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Madder Root:</strong> Produces warm reds and russets. This expensive dye, requiring multiple applications, indicated status and wealth</li>
                    <li><strong>Woad and Indigo:</strong> Create blue colors. Though less common in Swedish textiles than in other cultures, indigo blue appears in formal pieces</li>
                    <li><strong>Weld and Dyer's Broom:</strong> Produce bright and muted yellows</li>
                    <li><strong>Walnut Husks:</strong> Create warm browns</li>
                    <li><strong>Oak Gall:</strong> Produces grays and blacks, often used with madder for depth</li>
                    <li><strong>Lichen and Plant Materials:</strong> Various plants yield greens, purples, and subtle variations</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Dyeing Processes</h3>
                <p>Traditional dyeing required sophisticated knowledge:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fiber preparation through carding and spinning affected dye absorption</li>
                    <li>Mordants (fixatives) like alum or iron altered color depth and tone</li>
                    <li>Multiple immersions built color gradually, creating subtle variations</li>
                    <li>Seasonal timing affected dye availability and results</li>
                    <li>Regional variations in water chemistry influenced final colors</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Characteristic Textile Colors</h3>
                <p>Swedish cottage textiles favor specific color ranges reflecting available dyes and cultural preferences:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rich madder reds ranging from rust to deep burgundy</li>
                    <li>Warm browns and taupes from vegetable dyes and undyed fibers</li>
                    <li>Subtle yellows and golds</li>
                    <li>Deep indigo blues in special occasion textiles</li>
                    <li>Soft, grayed tones from overdyed combinations</li>
                    <li>Off-white and cream from natural linen and wool</li>
                </ul>

                    <li><strong>Overall Patterns:</strong> Repeating motifs covering entire textile surface</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Regional Pattern Styles</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dalarna:</strong> Bold, complex patterns with multiple colors. Densely patterned designs reflecting cultural confidence</li>
                    <li><strong>Värmland:</strong> Simpler patterns with greater restraint. Geometric structures with subtle colored accents</li>
                    <li><strong>Blekinge:</strong> Balanced approach combining complexity with clarity. Mediterranean influences occasionally visible</li>
