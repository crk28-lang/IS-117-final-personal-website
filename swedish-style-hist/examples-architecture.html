                <h2>The Swedish Cottage: Form and Function</h2>
                <p>Swedish cottage architecture reflects the practical demands of northern climate combined with aesthetic refinement that emerged over centuries. Unlike architectural styles defined by ornamental expression, Swedish cottage design prioritizes protection from harsh elements, efficient use of space, and harmony with the landscape.</p>
                <p>The typical Swedish cottage evolved to address specific environmental challenges: long, dark winters requiring heat retention; substantial snowfall requiring sloped roofs; limited daylight necessitating thoughtful window placement; and abundant timber providing the primary building material.</p>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Structural Characteristics</h2>

                <h3>Building Form and Orientation</h3>
                <p>Traditional Swedish cottages typically feature a simple, rectangular floor plan optimized for efficiency and heat conservation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Linear Forms:</strong> Simple rectangular or L-shaped plans maximize livable space while minimizing exterior surface area exposed to weather</li>
                    <li><strong>Directional Orientation:</strong> Buildings often oriented to optimize sun exposure during long winters and minimize exposure to prevailing winds</li>
                    <li><strong>Entry Placement:</strong> Entrances typically positioned on leeward sides or sheltered by vestibules to reduce heat loss</li>
                    <li><strong>Compact Living:</strong> Multi-functional rooms designed to concentrate household activities and heat</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Roofing Systems</h3>
                <p>The roof represents the most critical architectural element, developed specifically for northern conditions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Steep Pitch:</strong> High-pitched roofs (often 45-55 degrees) shed snow and rain efficiently, preventing accumulation</li>
                    <li><strong>Extended Eaves:</strong> Deep overhangs protect walls from weather and create sheltered spaces</li>
                    <li><strong>Material:</strong> Traditionally tiled or shingled with materials that age gracefully—slate, clay tiles, or wood shingles</li>
                    <li><strong>Attic Space:</strong> High pitched roofs create valuable attic storage while providing thermal buffer</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Wall Construction</h3>
                <p>Walls demonstrate sophisticated understanding of insulation and durability:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Log Construction:</strong> Horizontal logs stacked with clay or moss chinking creates excellent insulation and longevity</li>
                    <li><strong>Timber Frame:</strong> Vertical timber frames with infill construction provided structural strength with material efficiency</li>
                    <li><strong>External Weathering:</strong> Exterior surfaces finished with tar, whitewash, or paint (particularly the iconic Falun Red) provide weather protection</li>
                    <li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> Strategic placement of small openings prevents moisture accumulation while maintaining thermal efficiency</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Window Design</h3>
                <p>Windows were carefully designed to balance light, heat loss, and material availability:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Small Panes:</strong> Multi-paned windows divided to reduce glass size, critical when glass was expensive and single panes prone to breakage</li>
                    <li><strong>Strategic Placement:</strong> South-facing windows maximize passive solar gain; north-facing windows minimized</li>
                    <li><strong>Interior Shutters:</strong> Movable insulated shutters close at night to reduce heat loss</li>
                    <li><strong>Simple Frames:</strong> Honest timber frames reflect straightforward construction without applied ornamentation</li>
                </ul>
